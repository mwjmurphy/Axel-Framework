# Axel-Framework

The AXEL Framework is a comprehensive suite of tools for building web-sites. Using the framework
reduces and may even remove the need for server side code.

The framework uses actions to perform tasks inside a web html page. Tasks vary in functionality
and can be a simple page insert to a complex control panel with database search and list. This
schema describes the core actions provided by the framework. Other schemas such as the "pager_db_actions"
describe other more specific actions such as database access, mapping, navigation etc.
