<div class="container axel_schema" ><p class="document" ><xsd:documentation >		<h4>Actions</h4></p><p class="document" >		The framework uses actions to perform tasks inside a web html page. Tasks vary in functionality		and can be a simple date format to a complex page insert.  This schema describes the core actions		provided by the framework.</p><p class="document" >		Actions are placed into the static html page content.  When that page is serviced by the server the		actions are replaced with the result of each action..</p><p class="document" >		The following example is an html page with an insert action. The insert action in this case inserts a page named		head.html into the html before it is shown on the browser.  The head.html as you might conclude contains the		css and javascript that this page requires.  It could contain anything needed by this and other pages. Now		any page that requires these css and javascripts can simply use the insert command to have them inserted into		the page. The insert action is highlighted in red.<br/></p><p class="document" >		When an action is processed on a web page the response from an action if not null will replace the		action content (syntax) on the web page. If the response is null the action syntax is removed from		the web page.</p><p class="document" >		Now start to think about dynamically building an html page, changing the content based on user		selections, retrieving data from a database or other such sources. Being able to seperate out		pages for specific tasks gives you object orientation. </p><p class="document" >		<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">			<h4>Skillset Required</h4>			<p>				A medium level of expertise in html and xml is required to work with the core actions.			</p>			<p>				A medium level of expertise in Javascript and JSON is required to interact with these actions.  			</p> 		</div></p><p class="document" >	</xsd:documentation></p></div>
