These tools will build the largest part of the storage definition.		The presentation values such as width, height, regex, pattern etc are yours to configure as you need.</p><p class="document" >		The actions in the "pager_db_actions.xsd" are used to present the data from the storage database		definition to the user.</p><p class="document" >		<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">			<h4>Skillset Required</h4>			A level of expertise in database development, xml and html is required to work with storage			definitions.
