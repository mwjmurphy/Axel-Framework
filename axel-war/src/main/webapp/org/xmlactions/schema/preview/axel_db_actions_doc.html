<div class="container axel_schema" ><p class="document" ><xsd:documentation >		<h4>Database Actions</h4></p><p class="document" >		The Database Actions schema "pager_db_actions.xsd" describes the actions that are used to work		with one or more databases.  These actions bind database fields to the presentation fields		(html inputs). While the framework has a simple presentation layer for quick and easy presentation		of the data it is also highly customizable giving you complete control on how the data is presented		on screen. </p><p class="document" >		Database actions compliment the pager_actions.xsd schema.  It is recommended that you use		the "axel" namespace to reference the pager_actions and use the "db" namespace to reference		this pager_db_actions.xsd schema.  These are only recomendations and any namespace may be used.</p><p class="document" >		The following is a list of the primary database actions:<br/>		<a href="#list">list</a> - draws a presentation of inputs from a database query.<br/>		<a href="#listcp">listcp</a> - draws a control panel for a list display.  This includes media like inputs for paging over large list results.<br/>		<a href="#search">search</a> - draws a search input as part of a control panel.<br/>		<a href="#add">add</a> - draws a presentation of inputs for adding a record to the database.<br/>		<a href="#edit">edit</a> - draws a presentation of inputs for editing a record.<br/></p><p class="document" >		Actions use a database defined by the "storage.xsd" schema for information on the database. </p><p class="document" >		Database actions are placed in the html pages and when executed on the server the result		of the action either replaces the action on the page or is stored for later use.</p><p class="document" >		<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">			<h4>Standards/Conventions</h4>			<p>				When working with the database actions you should reference a field by combining				the table name with the field name using a dot seperator. i.e. <b>"table.fieldname"</b>.				Following this convention you quickly become familiar with where your data is				located in the database.			</p>			<p>								While it is possible to work with a single table using just the field name it is				not possible to do so when working with data from multiple tables. By using the				"table.fieldname" convention you can accurately work with data across multiple				tables. 			</p>		</div>		<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">			<h4>Skillset Required</h4>			<p>				A medium level of expertise in html and xml is required to work with database actions. You should				also be able to understand the storage definition of the tables and fields contained in the				database.			</p>			<p>				A low level of expertise in SQL is required to use "where", "order_by" and "group_by" attributes				when using filters and sorted on a query.			</p>			<p>				A medium level of expertise in Javascript and JSON is required to interact with these actions.  			</p> 		</div>	</xsd:documentation></p></div>
