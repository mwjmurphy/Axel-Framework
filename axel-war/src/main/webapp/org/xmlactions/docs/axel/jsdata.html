Inspired by Ember Data, JSData is the model layer you've been craving. It consists
of a convenient framework-agnostic, in-memory store for managing your data, which
uses adapters to communicate with various persistence layers.
</p>

<p>
The most commonly used adapter is the http adapter, which is perfect for communicating
with your RESTful backend. localStorage, localForage, firebase and other adapters are
already available. On the server you could hook up to the SQL adapter 
(Postgres/MySQL/MariaDB/SQLite3) and add in the Redis adapter as a caching layer for your 
read endpoints. More adapters are coming, and you're free to implement your own.
See Adapters.

<p>
Unlike some libraries, JSData does not require the use of getters and setters, and doesn't
decorate your data with a bunch of cruft. JSData's internal change detection (via observe-js
or Object.observe in supporting browsers) allows for powerful use cases and an easy avenue for
implementing your own 3-way data-binding.
</p>

<p>
Supporting relations, computed properties, support for Node and the Browser, model lifecycle
control and a slew of other features, JSData is the tool for giving your data the respect it
deserves.
</p>

<p>
Written in ES6 and built for modern web development, JSData will save you thousands of lines
of code and make you cooler.
