<h1>Some of the Advantages of using AXEL</h1>
<br/>
<p>
Combining proven architectire techniques give AXEL a distinct advantages over other
frameworks and libraries when it comes to building web pages on the server.
</p>

<p>
With its comprehensive list of actions (functions) it brings data from database/s,
files, resources and presentation layer together into a deliverable html page.
</p>


<br/><h4>Faster Page Presentation</h4>
<p>
All pages are constructed on the middle tier server/s as opposed to the web browser.
This proven architecture is the fastest way to get a dynamic page from server to browser.
</p>

<br/><h4>Front Line Access To Your Databases.</h4>
<p>
Constructing pages on the server allows the framework to access your data quickly and
easily using the most efficient and performant connections with first line access to
database connections using industry standard resources on web and application servers.
</p>

<br/><h4>Front Line Access To File And Resources</h4>
<p>
Web and Application servers use proven techniques for loading and caching static data
retrieved from files and other resources. AXEL uses this to its advantage by pulling
data directly into the web page on the server instead of the web browser which can
be two or more layers away from the database.
</p>

<br/><h4>Sophisticated Actions</h4>
<p>
That can retrieve data from database, map the results into a presentation
form combine these with a search and pagination form and deliver the output
back to the browser.
</p>

<p>
Or retrieve data from a database, convert this to json and deliver the output as
json back to the ajax client.
</p>

<p>
Or build add and edit forms that can add and edit from multiple tables.
</p>

<br/><h4>Simple Actions</h4>
<p>
That can combine html objects from multiple files so you get objected oriented html.
</p>

<p>
And can build expression if/elseif/else logic into pages that can dynamically change
the presentation output.
</p>

<br/><h4>Language Aware Actions</h4>
<p>
That make it a simple task to build a site that can change language without having to
build pages for specific languages.
</p>

<br/><h4>Formatting Actions</h4>
<p>
That support date formatting allowing the page to present the date and or time as required.
</p>

<br/><h4>Escaping and Unescaping Actions</h4>
<p>
That use the Apache Commons StringEscapeUtils and StringUnescapeUtils to change the data
content suitable for presentation in a number of different formats.
</p>

<br/><h4>Transform Actions</h4>
<p>
That use XML Style Sheets to convert XML document to different formats.
</p>

<br/><h4>Script Actions</h4>
<p>
That support inline javascript that is executed during the page build on the server.
</p>

<br/><h4>Mapping Actions</h4>
<p>
That use non-intrusive techniques to map data from XML to Java and Java to XML.
</p>

<br/><h4>Code Actions</h4>
<p>
That enable the html pages being constructed on the server to make calls directly into your
server code without the need for servlets.
