<h1>Why AngularJS?</h1>
<p>
HTML is great for declaring static documents, but it falters when we try to use it for 
declaring dynamic views in web-applications. AngularJS lets you extend HTML vocabulary
for your application. The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, readable,
and quick to develop.
</p>

<h1>Alternatives</h1>
<p>
Other frameworks deal with HTMLâ€™s shortcomings by either abstracting away HTML, CSS,
and/or JavaScript or by providing an imperative way for manipulating the DOM. Neither
of these address the root problem that HTML was not designed for dynamic views.
</p>

<h1>
Extensibility
</h1>
<p>
AngularJS is a toolset for building the framework most suited to your application
development. It is fully extensible and works well with other libraries. Every feature
can be modified or replaced to suit your unique development workflow and feature needs.
