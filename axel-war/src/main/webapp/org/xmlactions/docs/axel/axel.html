<h1>A<small>ctive</small> X<small>ML</small> E<small>xtension</small> L<small>anguage</small> Framework</h1>
<br/>
<p>
	The AXEL Framework is a comprehensive suite of tools for building web-sites.  Using the framework
	reduces and may even remove the need for server side code.
</p>
<p>	
	But it's not just about reducing code it's really about placing the work where it's most appropriate.
	The frameworks view of creating web-sites is from the web page.  As a page is being serviced on the
	server it enables the page to interact directly with business logic, databases, files, resource,
	basically anything that it needs. 
</p>
<p>
	This technique may seem out of line with the thinking behind most other frameworks! it is. Instead
	of building from the server side out, build it from the web page in.  Most successful designs begin
	with the user interface, focusing on the interaction between the user and the application. Thinking
	"I want to find something, I want to save that, add one of these, show me those..." all interactive,
	with the user doing something and the application responding.
</p>
<p>
	Making the web-site work as the user expects, within a budget and a time-frame isn't easy. Bigger
	projects, bigger risks, ongoing changes, maintenance etc. The usual project life-cycle.  Frameworks
	in a constant state of flux, one day its this, the next day its something else.    
</p>
<p>
	A major player is now a user interface developer, who is skilled at html5, css3, javascript, and a good
	knowledge of javascript libraries and frameworks, with a little knowledge of what's happening on the
	server side and the database.  Can there really be a developer with front-end, middle-tier and back-end
	expertise? If there is, there isn't that many and they surely cost a lot.
</p>
<p>
	Now how to get a ui-developer, a middle-tier developer and a database developer to work together.
	Thinking "I need this, can you do that, who can do this, where does that come from...".  Each has their
	own domain and the knowledge to make it work.
</p>
<p>
	Well this framework won't fix all the problems but it does help with uniting the workload. Combining the
	database, the mid-tier and the front end into one non-restrictive framework.  We say non-restrictive in
	the sense that one solution may not fit all, you may need or want to include and combine other frameworks
	and / or libraries into your solution which is expected with this framework.
