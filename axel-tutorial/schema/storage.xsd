		<h4>Storage - database definitions</h4>
			
		The storage schema describes the details of a database in a way that the framework
		understands. From this description the framework can move data in and out of a database
		and present	it to a browser using forms such as Add, Edit, List or as XML or JSON formatted data.
			
		Contained in the storage definition are databases, tables, fields, functions, customised sql.
		These are extended by you with additional information specifically for presentation.
			
		Using tools included with the framework you can build a storage definition by reverse engineering
		a database from it's metadata. These tools will build the largest part of the storage definition.
		The presentation values such as width, height, regex, pattern etc are yours to configure as you need.
		
		The actions in the "pager_db_actions.xsd" are used to present the data from the storage database
		definition to the user.
		
		<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
			<h4>Skillset Required</h4>
			A level of expertise in database development, xml and html is required to work with storage
			definitions. When constructed correctly storage definitions create a strong foundation for
			your application development.

            A foreign key definition.
            
            A foreign key is a reference to another table in the database and is how the framework links these
            tables.  This is defined by the metadata of a database and the key value is usually the Primary Key
            of another table.  See <a href="#pk"><abbr title="Primary Key"><b>pk</b></abbr></a> on Primary Keys.
            The database metadata will contain the table name and the field of the foreign key.
            
            The tools mentioned at the start of the schema will construct the foreign key table and field name
            from the database metadata.  If your building the definition by hand you will need to enter the
            the foreign key table and field name.

			A table path is used to identify relationship tables when a "fk" (foreign key) is not used directly between the
			two tables and a link table is used instead.
			
			It identifies which tables are linked in the relationship.  The relationship can be a 'OneToOne', 'OneToMany', 'ManyToOne' and 'ManyToMany'.
