    <h3>How It Works</h3>
    <p class="text-justify">
        Axel works by calling actions it finds on a web page.  These actions are added to the web page by the web site developer.
        When the action is called it replaces the action content on the web page with the result of the action.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
        An action looks like
        <code>
            <pre>
                &lt;axel:insert page="title.html"/>
            </pre>
        </code>
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
        The result of this action will replace the action content with the content of the page named <i>title.html</i>.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
        Now we have html components - on any page where you want to show the title you simply add this action.  The inserted page
        may also have axel actions which will be processed before the page is inserted.
    </p>
    <p class="test-justify">
        There are many actions that perform different tasks, the insert action is a simple instruction yet introduces the powerfull
        concept of html components in their native form.  The examples on this page show how to use the other actions and their benifits.
