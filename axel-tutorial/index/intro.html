        The framework is designed to build web pages for presentation on the web browser.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
        Under the hood it has java, spring framework, tools for building presentations layers from xml and json and services that
        can reach out to other resources.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
        On top of this, larger teams can add java and javascript developers to build more complex backend and frontend systems.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
        The framework encourages component page development, making it easier to build and manage large projects.  It also fits in
        with other front end frameworks such as Angular, React and NodeJs - building json feeds from the server and standardising
        and normalising the data content from the backend.
    </p>
